              <p>
                Hello there! I'm Josh Thomas, a 25-year-old junior software
                engineer based in Caerphilly. By day, I'm immersed in the world
                of coding, building digital solutions and embracing the
                challenges that come with it.
              </p>

              <p>
                But beyond the screen, I'm a guitarist, finding joy in weaving
                melodies and stories through the strings. Music is my way of
                expressing what words can't capture.
              </p>

              <p>
                Weight training is another passion of mine, a grounding practice
                that teaches me discipline and resilience. And when I'm not in
                front of a computer or with a guitar in hand, you'll likely find
                me exploring the wonders of aviation.
              </p>

              <p>
                This website is my virtual spaceâ€”a hub where potential employers
                can dive into my coding portfolio, and where I can share my
                musical projects. It's a reflection of the dual worlds I
                inhabit, showcasing my technical skills alongside my love for
                music. Thanks for stopping by!
              </p>
